OpenStack High Availability Guide
=================================

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This guide describes how to install and configure OpenStack for high
availability. It supplements the Installation Guides
and assumes that you are familiar with the material in those guides.

.. warning::

   This guide is a work-in-progress and changing rapidly
   while we continue to test and enhance the guidance. There are
   open `TODO` items throughout and available on the OpenStack manuals
   `bug list <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals?field.tag=ha-guide>`_.
   Please help where you are able.
