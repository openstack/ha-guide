This guide can be split into two parts:

#. High level architecture
#. Reference architecture examples, monitoring, and testing

.. warning::
   We recommend using this guide for assistance when considering your HA cloud.
   We do not recommend using this guide for manually building your HA cloud.
   We recommend starting with a pre-validated solution and adjusting to your
   needs.

High availability is not for every user. It presents some challenges.
High availability may be too complex for databases or
systems with large amounts of data. Replication can slow large systems
down. Different setups have different prerequisites. Read the guidelines
for each setup.

.. important::

   High availability is turned off as the default in OpenStack setups.
